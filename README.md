Hello My name is Raja and This repository contains the Front-end Code of EmployeManagement Full-Stack Web Application. This is My Second Web application project which i have created by myself.

I have used React for the front-End part in which i have used bootstrap and tailwind css to make my project look more attractive. This project is better than i have create before because using Javascript i have used my own validation for the input fields that when you 
are adding a new Employee data in database so you have to fill all the input fields and only then you can save the Data of new Employee.

When You click on All The Employees button it will take you to other page which contains all the employee details which are in our database and there are 2 more options that you can use for each employee which are EDIT & DELETE. 

DELETE BUTTON - When you want to remove an employee from your database you can just click on delete button of that specific employee and it will remove that employee from your database. 

EDIT BUTTON - When you want to edit or change some data of any employee in you database you can click on Edit button of that specific employee and it will take you to a new page, In this page you can see the Old Details of that employee with the Employee-ID and the other input fields that allows you to update or change the data of that employee and once you are done after filling all the input fields, you can click on SAVE BUTTON, When you click on Save button it will update the details of that specific employee in database and take you back to the page where all the employees data is displayed and you can see the changes that you made.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
